# Localization Engineering

## Overview

It's a project focused on synchronizing the data from your Google Sheets account into your Gridly account AND the other way around if need be. Orchestrated with a simple cron job to run at 6 PM everyday. Fit for small and quick localization batches. For anything major consider other options.

## Features


- **Feature 1**: Synchronization of data between Google Sheets and Gridly accounts
- **Feature 2**: Support for multiple spreadsheets and worksheets within a single project
- **Feature 3**: Error handling for failed synchronizations
- **Feature 4**:Integration with the cron job system to automate syncs

## Usage

To use this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.8 or higher)
2. [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/) (version 20.0 or higher)
3. [Google Sheets API client library for Python](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python)
4. [Gridly Client library for Python](https://github.com/gridly-dev/gridly-python-sdk)

```bash
[pip install -r requirements.txt]
```

Hereâ€™s how you could use this project:

1. **Step 1**: Prepare all the necessary environment variables at the very least you need 
- `SPREADSHEET_NAME`
- `WORKSHEET_NAME`
- `GRIDLY_API_KEY`
- `VIEW_ID`
2. **Step 2**: Get the credentials.json from Google Sheets' API, it might be tedious and tricky and is probably the most annoying step
- `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE`
3. **Step 3**: Adjust the code specific to your needs, you might not want to sync just a single view(though I like the granularity of it), but instead make a huge sync of all the views with a lot of sheets, let's say once a day/week or whatever.
